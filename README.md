# BudgetBuddy

A simple React Based money management app that can help you track your incomes and expenses. I used Next.JS for both front-end and back-end. I also used PostgreSQL through Prisma ORM and Neon as my database. For authentication, I used NextAuth.

## Installation
Make sure Node and npm are installed in your system. I used Node 21.6.1 and npm 10.2.4

then, run:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
